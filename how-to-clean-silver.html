 <h1>How to Clean Silver</h1>
  <p>Have you ever found yourself seated at a table of tarnished or dull silverware wondering how to clean the silver? A logn time ago your grandmother may have told you to clean silver you needed to roll up your sleeves and use some elbow grease. Thankfully with modern science on our side silver cleaning is a much mroe pleasant experience. These are some very simple and relatively fast ways to get your silver clean with things you probably already have at home.</p>
 
  
  <h2>Sterling Silver How To Clean All Types</h2>
  <p>Using these silver cleaning techniques you can clean any kind of silver whether it's jewelry, silverware, household items, or decorations. With that said though, keep in mind that this means that the item is made entirely out of only silver. If the item in question has inset stones, is painted, or has any other material used in unison with the silver, you should research the additional material separately. The cleaning of silver listed here is meant for silver alone.</p>

<h4>Ketchup</h4>
  <p>This is one of our favorites silver cleaning hacks because most people already has this item at home, and they know exactly where it is. You can either soak the silver in ketchup for 15 minutes before you start buffing out the tarnish, or you can try just using the ketchup immediately. Squeeze out about a teaspoon of ketchup onto a paper towel and start cleaning the silver. You'll be able to tell in a minute or two if you need more ketchup, or if the item needs to soak. Rinse the silver thoroughly afterwards, dry it, and put it away.</p>

<h4>Aluminum Foil</h4>
  <p>This is one of the best ways to clean tarnished silver. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with a liter of boiling water and a decent size of aluminum foil. Put your silver in for 10-15 seconds or longer, and then remove it. Rinse it and set it to the side. If it still has some tarnish then keep buffing it with a silver cloth or soft piece of fabric.</p>

<h4>Cornstarch</h4>
<p>Cornstarch can be used to clean silver at home too, though it requires a little more physical labor. Take a small bowl and mix water with cornstarch until it has a paste quality. You can make more batches/paste as you need it. Soak a cloth with water and then ring it out. Now use the cloth to remove the silver tarnish. Rinse the silver thoroughly once your done.

<h4>Laundry Detergent</h4>
<p>Use a medium bowl and line it with aluminum foil. If you need to clean many pieces the line more bowls. You don't want the silver so stacked that different spots can't be penetrated. Fill the bowl(s) with hot water. Mix in a tablespoon of laundry detergent and let each bowl soak for one minute. Rinse thoroughly and dry the silver with a soft cloth. Use regular laundry detergent, not super potent formulas(you don't want to waste it after all).</p>

<h4>Toothpaste</h4>
<p>To clean silver with toothpaste, squeeze a generous amount onto a soft cloth and start polishing your silver. There's no need to pre-rinse your pieces.

Be sure when drying the sterling silver to also use another soft cloth. You can use the cheapest toothpaste!</p>

<p>Let your silver items sit in a bowl of soda for on hour and watch what happens. You'll want to use a citrus flavor. While lemon and lime mixes are best, you can also try just lemon soda or just lime soda. Be sure to set a timer so that you don't forget that your silver is soaking. Be sure to thoroughly rinse everything after the timer goes off. Then use a silver, or very soft cloth, to dry out the items as much as possible before storing them away.</p>

<h4>Chalk(Tarnish Prevention)</h4>
<p>Not used for cleaning, chalk can be stored with your silver to help prevent silver tarnish. Chalk is a very dry material. That's partially why it wipes away so easily and is so soft. This soft, dry material helps to absorb moisture which is the enemy or your fine silver. Store some chalk in your silver drawer and help keep your best silver shining and bright.</p>

<h4>Ammonia</h4>
<p>Soak your silver pieces in 1 cup water and 1/2 cup clear ammonia for 10 minutes. Clean the silver with a soft cloth, rinse, and then dry again. While easy to use, ammonia isn't our favorite cleaning recommendation. It works well, but if you're new to using ammonia, you may be surprised at the unpleasant odor of this chemical. It's worth looking at the other silver cleaning suggestions here to see if you can find a more pleasant experience for yourself and those around you.</p>

You can also take it to a specialist to have it cleaned if it's a very valuable piece that you're concerned about damaging.</p>

  <h4>Vodka</h4>
  <p>This method is better for small silver jewelry items. Mix some water and about a cup of cheap vodka in a bowl. Place the items inside and let them soak for 5-7 minutes before rinsing and buffing. Vodka won't clean severe or thick tarnish well enough, so use it when items have just turned slightly. The best part? You can make yourself a drink at the same time.</p>

  <h4>Beer</h4>
  <p>Yes you can even use beer to remove silver tarnish from jewelry and other items. This a good alternative to the vodka mixture and is slightly stronger. If you have smaller items like silver necklaces, bracelets and rings, beer is a great way to clean silver. No mixing is required here. Pour a beer into a bowl or shallow dish. Line the jewelry inside the dish or pan, and let it soak for 5-10 minutes. Try not to stack pieces so that every surface is cleaned by the beer. Rinse, dry, and wear it!</p>
